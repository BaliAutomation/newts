1.1.0
~~~~~

Support for `HTTP Basic Auth`_ has been added.

Introduced a very simple web interface based on AngularJS_.  Practical
applications of this UI are probably quite limited, nevertheless it should
provide a handy means of performing quick resource index searches, or
generating simple ad hoc graphs.  To give it a try, point your browser at:
http://localhost:8080/ui/ (adjusting hostnames and port as needed).

The Karaf_ feature Maven_ module was renamed from ``karaf``, to ``newts-karaf``.
Update dependency names accordingly.
