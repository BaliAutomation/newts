I'm very excited to have the opportunity to [present on Newts](http://sched.co/1pbkYbs) at [Apachecon EU](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/apachecon-europe) this year.  It's always great to get out of the echo chamber and chat with the folks from the other side of the pond, and Budapest seems like a fantastic venue for an international conference.

Hope to see you there!
