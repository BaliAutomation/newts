I'm fortunate enough to be presenting at [Berlin Buzzwords](http://berlinbuzzwords.de) again this year, this time on [Time Series Data with Cassandra](http://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/time-series-data-apache-cassandra).  My talk will cover [OpenNMS](http://www.opennms.org) as a use-case for time series data, why [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) is such a good fit, and includes an introduction to Newts.

Buzzwords is the highlight of my year as far as conferences go, if your interests lie in
search, storage, and scale, it's tough to beat.  Hope to see you there!
