{"name":"Newts","tagline":"New-fangled Timeseries Data Store","body":"### Features\r\nNewts is a time-series data store based on [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org), it's features include:\r\n\r\n * _High throughput_ &ndash; Newts is built upon [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org), a write-optimized, fully distributed partioned row store.\r\n * _Grouped access_ &ndash; It's common to collect, store, and retrieve metrics together, (think bytes in and bytes out, or 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages.); Newts allows for similar metrics to be grouped together for more efficient storage and retrieval.  \r\n * _Late aggregation_ &ndash; Most time-series solutions perform in-line aggregations for purposes of later ploting visualizations, even though the ratio of reads to write is staggeringly small.  Newts performs plot aggregations at the time of the read.\r\n\r\n### Bugs\r\nhttp://issues.opennms.org/browse/NEWTS\r\n","google":"UA-50104830-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
