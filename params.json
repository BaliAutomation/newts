{"name":"Newts","tagline":"New-fangled Timeseries Data Store","body":"Newts\r\n=====\r\n\r\nNewts is a time-series data store based on `Apache Cassandra`_.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\nHigh throughput\r\n  Newts is built upon `Apache Cassandra`_, a write-optimized, fully distributed partioned row store.\r\nGrouped access\r\n  It's common to collect, store, and retrieve metrics together, (think bytes in and bytes out, or 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages.); Newts allows for similar metrics to be grouped together for more efficient storage and retrieval.  \r\nLate aggregation\r\n  Most time-series solutions perform in-line aggregations for purposes of later ploting visualizations, even though the ratio of reads to write is staggeringly small.  Newts performs plot aggregations at the time of the read.\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n----\r\n\r\nhttp://issues.opennms.org/browse/NEWTS\r\n  \r\nTerminology\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nResource\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\nResources are unique strings that identify a metric, or group of metrics.\r\n\r\nMeasurements vs. Samples\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nSamples represent the raw, or *sampled* data.  Measurements are calculated from the collected samples.\r\n\r\n.. _Apache Cassandra: http://cassandra.apache.org\r\n","google":"UA-50104830-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
