{"name":"Newts","tagline":"New-fangled Timeseries Data Store","body":"Newts is a time-series data store based on [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org), it's features include:\r\n\r\n * _High throughput_ &ndash; Newts is built upon [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org), a write-optimized, fully distributed partioned row store.\r\n * _Grouped access_ &ndash; It's common to collect, store, and retrieve metrics together, (think bytes in and bytes out, or 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages.); Newts allows for similar metrics to be grouped together for more efficient storage and retrieval.  \r\n * _Late aggregation_ &ndash; Most time-series solutions perform in-line aggregations for purposes of later ploting visualizations, even though the ratio of reads to write is staggeringly small.  Newts performs plot aggregations at the time of the read.\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n----\r\n\r\nhttp://issues.opennms.org/browse/NEWTS\r\n  \r\nTerminology\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nResource\r\n~~~~~~~~\r\nResources are unique strings that identify a metric, or group of metrics.\r\n\r\nMeasurements vs. Samples\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nSamples represent the raw, or *sampled* data.  Measurements are calculated from the collected samples.\r\n","google":"UA-50104830-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
